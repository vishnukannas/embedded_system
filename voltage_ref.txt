Hai guys,
    In this blog we discuss about what are the various kinds of voltage sources we are seeing in any electronics devices we handling day by day that is like actully a 5 variants, they are
1. Vcc = Voltage Collector Collector
2. Vdd = Voltage Drain Drain
3. Vss = Voltage Source Source
4. Vee = Voltage Emitter Emitter
5. GND = Ground
why this difference happening, kindly refer below paragraph also
Because of the two major transistor behind the story 
1. Bipolar Junction Transistor
In Bipolar terminals have like Base, Collector (Vcc), Emitter (Vee) 
2. Field Effect Transistor
In FET terminals are Gate, Drain(Vdd), Source(Vss)
